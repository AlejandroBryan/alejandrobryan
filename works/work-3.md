My-Flixx is a movie API that I developed as part of my backend web development portfolio. This project demonstrates my skills in creating a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). With My-Flixx, users can interact with a comprehensive collection of movies, benefiting from features such as browsing, searching, and securely managing their accounts.

The primary objective of My-Flixx is to serve as a centralized movie database accessible through a RESTful API. Users can retrieve detailed information about movies, including titles, genres, release years, and more. To ensure secure user authentication, My-Flixx incorporates JWT, allowing only registered users to access features like favoriting movies, leaving reviews, and managing their personal accounts.

One of the core features of My-Flixx is its ability to effectively manage movie data. The API supports CRUD operations, enabling administrators to add new movies, update existing records, and remove obsolete entries. Users can retrieve a list of movies or search for specific movies based on various criteria, such as genre, title, or release year. The API responds with relevant movie data, including detailed information and user ratings.

My-Flixx provides user registration and login functionality using JWT. Once authenticated, users receive a token that grants access to protected endpoints and allows for personalization of their movie experience. Authenticated users can leave reviews for movies, add favorites to their personal list, and manage their account settings.

Technically, My-Flixx is built using Node.js and Express, creating a robust server-side environment for handling HTTP requests and responses. MongoDB is utilized as the database for storing movie information, user data, and related records. The flexibility and scalability of MongoDB make it an ideal choice for managing complex data. The implementation of JWT ensures secure authentication and authorization for protected endpoints.

In conclusion, My-Flixx is a powerful and feature-rich movie API that showcases my skills in backend web development. By building My-Flixx, I have demonstrated proficiency in data management, user authentication, and RESTful API design. This project serves as a valuable asset in my portfolio, highlighting my abilities as a backend web developer.
