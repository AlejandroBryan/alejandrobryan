## Discover Careerfoundry Events in Your City with Google's API Calendar, and a Progressive Web App (PWA).

Meet is a personal project developed to help individuals discover and explore Careerfoundry events happening in their cities. Leveraging AWS Lambda, serverless functions, React, React-Bootstrap, Google's API Calendar, and Progressive Web App (PWA) conversion, Meet provides a seamless and engaging experience for users to fetch and view upcoming events. In this portfolio, I will explain the objectives, features, and technical aspects of the Meet project, highlighting my skills in serverless computing, front-end development, API integration, and PWA conversion.

### Project Objectives

Event Discovery: The primary objective of the Meet project was to create a platform where users could easily discover Careerfoundry events happening in their cities. By integrating with Google's API Calendar, I aimed to provide accurate and up-to-date information on upcoming events.

User-Friendly Interface: Meet focused on delivering a user-friendly experience, ensuring that visitors can easily search for events by their city, view event details, and quickly access essential information such as date, time, location, and event description.

Progressive Web App (PWA) Conversion: I aimed to enhance the Meet project by converting it into a Progressive Web App (PWA). This would allow users to access the application from their device's home screen, enjoy offline capabilities, and provide a native app-like experience across different platforms.

### Project Description

Backend Development with AWS Lambda: Utilizing AWS Lambda and serverless functions, I developed the backend architecture for Meet. AWS Lambda allowed me to create serverless functions that dynamically fetched event data from Google's API Calendar based on user requests, ensuring a scalable and cost-effective approach to handling backend operations.

Front-end Development with React and React-Bootstrap: The Meet front-end was developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and React-Bootstrap, a UI component library. This combination provided a robust foundation for creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

Event Search and Display: Meet enables users to search for events by specifying their city. The application then sends requests to the serverless functions, which fetch the corresponding event data from Google's API Calendar. The retrieved data is displayed in a structured and easily digestible format, allowing users to explore event details.

Google's API Calendar Integration: Meet integrated with Google's API Calendar to retrieve event data. The serverless functions made API requests to fetch upcoming events based on user-specified cities, providing real-time and accurate information.

Progressive Web App (PWA) Conversion: To enhance the Meet project, I converted it into a Progressive Web App (PWA). This involved implementing service workers, enabling offline capabilities, and adding a manifest file for installation prompts. By converting Meet into a PWA, users could access the application from their device's home screen and enjoy a native app-like experience.

### Technical Aspects

AWS Lambda and Serverless Functions: Meet utilized AWS Lambda and serverless functions to handle backend operations. The serverless functions interacted with Google's API Calendar, fetching event data based on user requests and delivering the relevant information to the front-end.

React and React-Bootstrap: I used React and React-Bootstrap to develop the user interface of the Meet platform. React's component-based architecture facilitated the creation of reusable and interactive UI elements, while React-Bootstrap's pre-styled components ensured a consistent and visually appealing design.

Google's API Calendar Integration: Meet integrated with Google's API Calendar to retrieve event data. The serverless functions made API requests to fetch upcoming events based on user-specified cities, providing real-time and accurate information.

Progressive Web App (PWA) Conversion: I implemented PWA features, including service workers and a manifest file, to convert Meet into a Progressive Web App. This allowed users to install the application, access it offline, and enjoy a native app-like experience across various devices and platforms.

##### Conclusion
Meet is a personal project that demonstrates my skills in serverless computing, front-end development, API integration, and PWA conversion. By leveraging AWS Lambda, React, React-Bootstrap, Google's API Calendar, and implementing PWA features, I created a user-friendly platform for discovering Careerfoundry events. The project showcases my ability to architect scalable and efficient applications, deliver intuitive user experiences, integrate external APIs for data retrieval, and enhance applications with PWA capabilities. Meet reflects my commitment to utilizing cutting-edge technologies to provide seamless and engaging experiences for users.
