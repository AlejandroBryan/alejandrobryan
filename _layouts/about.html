<h3 class="mb__1">From Chisel to Keyboard</h3>
<p>
  My odyssey began in the tactile world of woodcarving, where I was not just a craftsman but a storyteller. Each piece
  of wood under my chisel was a silent narrative waiting to unfold. This creative journey was acknowledged with numerous
  awards and honors, reflecting my dedication and skill in wood sculpting.
</p>

<p>
  Galleries and international art exhibitions were my arenas, where I connected with diverse audiences and fellow
  artists. Beyond personal artistic pursuits, I engaged with NGOs and community projects, imparting my knowledge and
  passion to children. These experiences were foundational, embedding in me a deep appreciation for creativity,
  teaching, and community service.

<h3 class="mb__1">Embracing Change in Germany</h3>

<p>
  2018 marked a pivotal shift in my life's canvas. Relocating to Germany, I was inspired by a new environment of
  innovation and opportunity. This move ignited a quest for a career transformation, leading me to seek a path that
  harmonized my artistic soul with the thrill of technological innovation.

<h3 class="mb__1">My Journey into Web Development</h3>
<p>
  My incursion into web development began with self-guided exploration, diving into online tutorials. However, I soon
  realized the need for a more structured and comprehensive learning path. This led me to enroll in the Careerfoundry
  full-stack web development program, a decision that marked the beginning of a profound transformation.
</p>
<p>
  Under expert mentorship, I dived into the realms of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond. This wasn't merely learning but
  a process of reshaping my thinking and adapting my artistic vision to the logical elegance of code. Each line of code
  became a stroke of my digital brush, each completed project a testament to my growth and potential.
