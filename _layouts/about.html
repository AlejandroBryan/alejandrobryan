<h1 class="mb-1">About me</h1>

<p>
   I am a full-stack developer, a father of two, and a husband. These aspects
   provide a well-rounded perspective on my identity. Originally from the
   Dominican Republic, I spent my formative years there before moving to
   Germany, "Na Servus" in 2018. Since then, I've engaged with various fields,
   collecting diverse experiences that have enriched my outlook.
</p>
<p>
   As a full-stack developer, my passion lies in finding the synergy between
   creativity and technical expertise. This portfolio documents my journey,
   highlighting my growth and progress over time. Each project encapsulates a
   phase of my development, from crafting seamless user interfaces to
   architecting complex back-end systems. Thank you for considering my
   portfolio. Whether you're interested in my technological endeavors, my family
   dynamics or enjoy personal narratives, I appreciate your time. Please contact
   me, especially if you see potential for collaboration or want to explore my
   journey as a full-stack developer.
