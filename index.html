        I am a newly graduated Full Stack Web Developer based in southern Germany, having recently completed a
        comprehensive full-stack web development course through CareerFoundry. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and the MERN stack, I am now actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a professional
        setting. My training has equipped me with both the technical and collaborative skills necessary for a role in
        web development, and I am eager to contribute to a dynamic team while continuing to grow and refine my abilities
        in this exciting field.
