## Overview
The My-flixx Angular application is a single-page, responsive web app developed to interface with the existing My-flixx server-side code. It provides a dynamic user experience for movie enthusiasts to access and interact with a wide range of movie information, including details about movies, directors, and genres.

### Purpose and Context
In an evolving remote work environment, effective communication and collaboration are key. This project, developed using Angular, focuses on building the client-side interface for My-flixx, complementing the server-side developed earlier. It emphasizes the importance of creating detailed documentation and handoff deliverables for seamless collaboration among developers and designers.

### Objectives
The primary goal was to develop a user-friendly client-side application for My-flixx that allows users to interact with the movie database. Key goals included enabling users to view movie details, register, manage their profiles, and save favorite movies, all supported by comprehensive documentation.

#### Process:

**Client-Side Development:**

The application was developed using Angular (version 9 or later), with Angular Material for design. It features user registration and login forms, and a variety of interface views for displaying movie information.

#### Key Functionalities and Views:
